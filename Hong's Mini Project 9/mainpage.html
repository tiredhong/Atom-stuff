    <div class="verse1">
    <p>
<dt>I threw a wish in the well</dt>
<dt>Don't ask me, I'll never tell</dt>
<dt>I looked to you as it fell</dt>
<dt>And now you're in my way</dt>
<dt>I trade my soul for a wish</dt>
<dt>Pennies and dimes for a kiss</dt>
<dt>I wasn't looking for this</dt>
<dt>But now you're in my way</dt></p>
</div>
<div class="pre-Chorus">
<p>
<dt>Your stare was holding</dt>
<dt>Ripped jeans, skin was showin'</dt>
<dt>Hot night, wind was blowin'</dt>
<dt>Where you think you're going, baby?</dt></p>
</div>

<div class="chorus">
<p><dt>Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy</dt>
<dt>But here's my number, so call me maybe</dt>
<dt>It's hard to look right at you, baby</dt>
<dt>But here's my number, so call me maybe</dt>
<dt>Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy</dt>
<dt>But here's my number, so call me maybe</dt>
<dt>And all the other boys try to chase me</dt>
<dt>But here's my number, so call me maybe</dt></p>
<div/>
<div class= "verse2">
<p><dt>You took your time with the call</dt>
<dt>I took no time with the fall</dt>
<dt>You gave me nothing at all</dt>
<dt>But still you're in my way</dt>
<dt>I beg and borrow and steal</dt>
<dt>At first sight and it's real</dt>
<dt>I didn't know I would feel it</dt>
<dt>But it's in my way</dt></p>
</div>

<div class="Pre-Chorus">
<p><dt>Your stare was holding</dt>

<p><dt>Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad</dt>
<dt>I missed you so bad</dt>
<dt>I missed you so, so bad</dt>
